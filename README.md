# 💡 About

After learning some Python during the 2021 Christmas Holidays, I've decided to put my knowledge into practice and solve a problem I was facing while working on a different project: **MetaHeadz**.

The script used a configuration file to open some images and read some data, validate that information, and finally generate and collection as well as the metadata for it.

Please go ahead and give it a try and let me know if you enjoyed it with a ⭐️, I would really appreciate it.

As always, PR's are welcome.
